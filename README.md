### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use css grid on the body tag to center my card on the page.

```css
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I struggled with adding margins to the card elements, so that will be something i will work on.
